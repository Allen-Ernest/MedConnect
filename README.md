# MedConnect
I am developing a nationwide collaborative platform for medical professionals to improve patient care outcomes. This final year project utilizes Dart for the core application logic and Flutter for the user interface framework. The backend leverages JavaScript, with Express.js handling APIs and a server-side UI built with React.js.
